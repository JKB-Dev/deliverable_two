# deliverable_two

Two things to note (these are true for both deliverables):

1). I didn't initially understand that I should have created the repository before beginning to work on the labs, so unfortunately they don't have commit histories showing my working process.

2). In both labs, I know that I'm unnecessarily repeating some code but couldn't think of a way around it. I'm looking forward to learning how to get my code cleaner and shorter!
